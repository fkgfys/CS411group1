1- As an avid concert go-er, I want to create an account and use it to log-in each time I use this web application, so that I can benefit from getting cheap flight tickets.

2- As a logical spender, I want to get cheap flight tickets, so that I can spend less money when I travel to another city for a concert.

3- As a logged-in user (refer to 1), I want to search up artists and get cheap options of flight tickets to their concert’s location (Refer to 2) and back to my original city the day after. This way, I will be getting the cheapest options for a round-trip to the city in which the concert is. 
(The app will already know the date of the concert. So, the user will be getting the cheapest options to fly the day before and then the day after.)

4- As a logged-in user (refer to 1), I want to get flight tickets (Refer to 2) to the concert I am attending (refer to 3); however, I want the dates to be more flexible. This way, I can choose how many days before and after I can stay in that city.
(Accomplished with a drag bar mechanism? - The user will choose the amount of days to stay before and after the concert in the second city)

5- As a logged-in user (refer to 1), I want to get cheap flight tickets (Refer to 2) for a concert’s city (refer to 3); however, instead of returning to my original location, I want to get tickets for another flight in a third city and then fly back to the first city, so that I can attend a second concert. 
(The app will alert the user, if accomplishing this is not possible - no flights, not enough time)
